# Personal-hacks

This project is for personal memory. Since I forgot what did I ate last night
for dinner I decided to write a git repository for my own documentation. If
this is useful for someone else please feel free to leave a comment. If you
have a question or I commit a mistake please feel free to rise a bug o feature
request :)
